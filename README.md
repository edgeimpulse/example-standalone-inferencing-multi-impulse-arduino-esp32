## Minimal example of multi-impulse inference with Arduino IDE and ESP-EYE

Place this folder to your Arduino libraries folder.

Restart the Arduino IDE.

Find the folder name in Examples. There choose esp32_multi_impulse example.

Choose ESP32 Wrover Module as your board, then upload the sketch.

Say ON to start FOMO inference and OFF to stop it.

**NOTE:** Keyword spotting model might need some more training - or decreasing slice size.
